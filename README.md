# InstaBot

## Introduction

Hello and welcome to InstaBot. This is where I track the weekly progress of the InstaBot that I've developed and deployed to increase interaction and engagment for the instagram page: https://www.instagram.com/incense_studio/.

My mother, Nidhi has been a life-long artist. She's spend many decades taking and delivering on custom orders but it was siloed and never displayed to the public, save for a few exhibitions.

In 2020, I finally convinced her to go online. 

Today, we have an active Shopify store (www.IncenseArtStudio.com) and a growing Instagram Page.

This is for me to track the performance of our InstaBot on a weekly basis. Being a Data Scientist, this was a very interesting project for me. Although this did not involve any data science yet, I can already see some potential that resides in the logs data - around finding newer accounts to get followers from (those with a high relationship ratio), using GPT3 to generate comments based on current comments, etc.

Thank you to the InstaPy team for maintaining and documenting this amazing library! I've created a PR with a minor bug fix, hope to contribute more over the next few months!
